            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>How naturally muſt it needs follow;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Chriſt's <hi>Converſion,</hi> and the powerful Preaching of the Goſpel, his means to effect it, muſt be <hi>ſlighted</hi> and <hi>deſpiſed; Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Prophaneſs,</hi> the true Intereſt of this State, neceſſarily; brought in; Chriſt's <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> with all the <hi>Spiritual Ends</hi> and <hi>

            <pb facs="tcp:103577:3"/>
            <p>For as they who take (as far as they can judg) <hi>living Stones</hi> (called the <hi>Spiritual Seed,</hi> Saints by Calling, or Believers) to build Chriſt a <hi>Houſe</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> Orderly joyning them <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi> by <hi>Dipping,</hi> Do yield Obedience to Chriſts <hi>Command, conform</hi> to the <hi>Primitive</hi> Patern of the New-<hi>Teſtament-Churches,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe <hi>honour</hi> and glory to the Lord Chriſt the <hi>Inſtitutor:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So they, who take the <hi>Carnal Seed,</hi> viz. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconverted</hi> ones, to make up the <hi>National,</hi> or any <hi>particular Church,</hi> joyning them together by <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> do thereby yeeld Obedience to the <hi>Popes Canons,</hi> conform to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian Pattern,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect Honour and Dignity to their Soveraign Lord the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Contriver</hi> and <hi>Impoſer</hi> thereof. And is not this very obſervable, that Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> the <hi>firſt,</hi> (that <hi>Abaddon</hi> and <hi>Apollyon</hi>) that had ſo many marks of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> as you'l find in the account here given of him, was the firſt <hi>Confirmer</hi> and <hi>Impoſer</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>But that which is moſt to be lamented is, That the <hi>Proteſtant Reformers,</hi> who detected and caſt away ſo many <hi>Antichriſtian Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> ſhould yet hold faſt ſuch a Principal <hi>Foundation</hi>-Stone of their <hi>Building;</hi> though it is granted, with the rejecting of many of its <hi>Superſtitions,</hi> and alſo upon other pretended <hi>Grounds.</hi> For when the <hi>Rotteneſs</hi> of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Grounds aforeſaid did appear for <hi>Infants-Sprinkling,</hi> it had certainly faln to the Ground, but for ſome <hi>new Contrivances</hi> to ſupport it, though therein they have not been ſo happy to agree amongſt themſelves in their Concluſions.</p>
            <p>For ſome are for <hi>Baptizing all Children,</hi> whoſe <hi>Parents</hi> are never ſo <hi>wicked;</hi> others
<pb facs="tcp:103577:4"/> only the Children of <hi>Profeſſors;</hi> whilſt others are for the Baptiſing the Children of ſuch Profeſſors only, whoſe <hi>Parents</hi> are <hi>Inchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, viz.</hi> Belonging to ſome particular <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</hi> Some are for <hi>Baptiſing Children</hi> upon their own <hi>particular Faith,</hi> (which with much confidence 'tis affirmed they have.) Others deny that with great Vehemency, affirming they ought only <hi>to be Baptiſed</hi> upon an <hi>Imputative Faith, viz.</hi> upon the Faith of others, though herein, as you'l find, they vaſtly <hi>differ;</hi> ſome ſaying, it muſt be by the <hi>Imputative Faith</hi> of the Church; others of the <hi>Goſſip;</hi> others of the <hi>Parent</hi> or <hi>Proparent</hi> in Covenant upon the account of <hi>Federal Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that ſome are for Baptiſing upon an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Faith, ſome an <hi>Imputative,</hi> ſome a <hi>Seminal,</hi> ſome an <hi>Habitual,</hi> ſome a <hi>Dogmatical,</hi> &amp; ſome upon a <hi>Juſtifying Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which Variety of Differences, you have Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf in the beginning of his Book of the Sacraments ſay, <hi>That it may ſeem ſtrange, that after</hi> 1600 <hi>Years uſe of Chriſtian Baptiſm, the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould be ſo unreſolved to whom it doth belong; Yet ſo it is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and I obſerve it is a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion that they are now very ſollicitous about: and I cannot blame them, it being not only about a matter of Divine appointment, but a practical of ſuch concernment to the Church.</hi>

               <p>But the Antecedent is true, therefore ſo is the Conſequent. In proof whereof he produces the ſeveral Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Perſons that were baptized, which (ſaith he) might afford us ſo many ſeveral Arguments, but I ſhall put them together, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>John,</hi> as I have ſhewed you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the profeſſion of true Repentance, and that his Baptiſme was for the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when Chriſt layeth down the Apoſtolical Commiſſion, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Order of the Apoſtles work, is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103577:19"/> firſt to make them Diſciples, and then to Baptize them into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>That it was ſaving Faith that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jews.</note> and profeſſed by them <hi>(Acts 2.38.)</hi> is plain in the Text.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Samaritans</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</note> believed, and had great Joy, and were baptized into the name of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Acts 8.12.</hi> whereby it appeareth, that it was both the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Will that were both changed, and that they had the profeſſion even of a ſaving Faith, yea, even <hi>Simon</hi> himſelf, <hi>37. v.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Condition upon which the <hi>Eunuch</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eunuch.</note> must be baptized was, if he believed with all his Heart, which he profeſſed to do, and that was the Evidence <hi>Philip</hi> expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Paul.</note> was baptized after true converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Acts 9.18.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Holy Ghoſt fell on the Gentiles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were baptized, <hi>Acts 10.44.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Lydia.</note>
                  <hi>Lydias</hi> Heart was opened before ſhe was baptized, and ſhe was one the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles judged faithful to the Lord, and offered to them the Evidence of her faith, <hi>Acts 16.30.</hi>

                  </note>For which we are beholding to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> for very convincing Arguments, upon his firſt Argument with Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> in the fore mentioned Book, <hi>viz,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he doth poſitively affirm, that we muſt not Baptize any without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of true Repentance, which he proves thus.</p>

Then we bring the Perſon thus waſhed and inſtructed to the Brethren; (as they are called) where the Aſſemblies are, that we may pray both for our ſelves and the new illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Perſon, that we may be found by true Doctrine, and by good Works worthy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers and keepers of the Commandments, and that we may attain Eternal Life and Salvation.

                     <hi>Dr.</hi> B. <hi>late Dr. of the Chair, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of great learning and eminency, hath theſe words in a Letter I have ſeen in Print.</hi> viz. I do believe and know that there is neither <hi>Precept nor Example</hi> in Scripture for <hi>Pedobaptiſme,</hi> nor any juſt evidence for it for above <hi>200</hi> years after Chriſt, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> condemns it as an unwarrantable Cuſtom, and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> a good while after him diſlikes it too, ſure I am that in the primitive times they were <hi>Chatacumeni,</hi> then <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minati or Baptizati;</hi> and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pagans, and Children of Pagans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, but Children of Chriſtian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, I do believe Pedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; how, or by whom I know not, came
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103577:50"/> into the world in the ſecond Century, and in the third and fourth began to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed, though not generally, and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as lawfull from the Text, groſly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood, <hi>Jo. 3.5,</hi> upon the like groſs mistake of <hi>Jo. 6.53.</hi> they did for many Centuries both in the Greek and Latin Church Communicate Infants, and give them the Lords Supper, and I do confeſs they might do both as well as either: But although they baptized ſome Infants, and thought it lawfull ſo to do; yet <hi>Auſtin</hi> was the firſt that ever ſaid it was neceſſary; and farther ſaith.</p>
                  <p>I have read what my learned and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy friends Dr. <hi>Hamond,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and others ſay in defence of it, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I wonder not a little, that men of ſuch great parts ſhould ſay ſo much to ſo little purpoſe; for I have not yet ſeen any thing like an Argument for it. <hi>Thus far Dr. B.</hi>

II.</hi> Wherein by an Hiſtorical Account of Infants Baptiſm in its Riſe and Eſtabliſhment, <hi>viz.</hi> when, by whom, and to what ends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, it doth appear, that there was no authentick Practice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of for <hi>300,</hi> nor any humane A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority enjoyning it till <hi>400</hi> years after Chriſt. Together with an account alſo of its growth, and how, and by what lying Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities it was; with many ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Rites, founded upon Apoſtolical Tradition; with the impious and ridiculous fooleries added to it in every Age.</head>
               <p>FRom the learned Authorities before given, we have gained thus much; That as there was no Precept in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the baptizing of Infants, ſo neither was there the leaſt Practice to be
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103577:67"/> found thereof in the Apoſtl's dayes, as was ſo ingenuouſly before confeſſed by the <hi>Magdiburgenſes, Luther, Calvin, Eraſmus, Rogers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the approved Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and known Cuſtom of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church was to baptize the <hi>Adult,</hi> as all Ages acknowledge, and only they (at leaſt) for the firſt Ages, as ſo fully atteſted by <hi>Euſebius, Beatus Rhenanus, Lud. Vives, Bullinger, Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> the <hi>Neocaeſarian</hi> Councel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That not only the Children of <hi>Pagans</hi> were as the <hi>Catachumens,</hi> to be inſtructed and taught in the Faith, in order to their Baptiſm; but the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Chriſtians alſo, as thoſe famous Inſtances given from the Fourth Century, by <hi>Field, Naucler, Daille, Grotius, Walafrid Strabo, Taylor,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The next thing we ſhall make appear is, that as there was no Scripture-Authority to inforce it, ſo there was no Humane-Authority to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn it till above 400 years after Chriſt, though to juſtifie that injunction, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical-Tradition, to ſupply the want of Scripture-Inſtitution was pretended; whereof you have by the way this

                     <hi>D.</hi> Taylor</note> P. 237. argues <hi>ſo fully and ſtrenuouſly</hi> upon this point of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> that I cannot paſs him by, who ſaith, <hi>Tradition by all means muſt ſupply the place of Scripture, and there is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> a Tradition <hi>Apoſtolical, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were baptized. But at this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we are not much moved, For we who rely upon the written Word of God, as ſufficient to eſtabliſh all true Religion, do not value the allegation of Tradition: And however the world goes, none of the</hi> Reformed <hi>Churches can pretend this Argument for this Opinion: Becauſe they who reject</hi> Tradition, <hi>when it is againſt them, muſt not pretend it in the leaſt for them; but if we allow the</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick <hi>to be good, yet how will it be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?

               <p>Firſt. <hi>Perſonal and Actual Faith they

And whatſoever can be ſaid to take off from the neceſſity of Actual Faith, all that and much more may be ſaid to excuſe from the actual ſuſception of Baptiſme. The firſt of theſe devices was that of</hi> Luther <hi>and his Scholars; the ſecond of</hi> Calvin <hi>and his, and yet
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103577:106"/> there is a</hi> third <hi>Device, which the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>teaches, and that is, that</hi> Infants <hi>have habitual Faith; but who told them ſo? How can they prove it? What Revelation or Reaſon teacheth any ſuch thing? Are they by this habit ſo much as diſpoſed to an actual Belief, without a new Maſter? Can an Infant, ſent into a</hi> Mahumetan <hi>Province be more confident for Chriſtianity, when he comes to be a Man, than if he had not been baptized? Are there any Acts prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, concomitant, or conſequent to this pretended Habit?

               <p>
                  <hi>To which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>this Conſideration may be added, That if</hi> Baptiſme <hi>be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Salvation of Infants</hi> (as the Fathers of old, and the Church of <hi>Roms</hi> and <hi>England</hi> ſince) <hi>upon whom is the impoſition laid? To whom is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand given? To the Parents, or the Children? Not to the Parents, for then God hath put the Salvation of innocent Babes into the Power of others, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants may be damned for their Fathers careleſneſs or malice. It follows that it
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103577:106"/> is not neceſſary at all to be done to them, to whom it cannot be preſcribed as a Law, and in whoſe behalf it cannot be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly entruſted to others, with the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent neceſſity; and if it be not neceſſary, it is certain it is not reaſonable, and moſt certain it is no where in terms preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; and therefore it is preſumed that</hi> Baptiſm <hi>ought to be underſtood and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred according as other Precepts are with reference to the capacity of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and the reaſonableneſs of the thing.</hi>

               <p>It is granted there are in ſome things an Analogy betwixt the one and the other, both ſignifying Heart-Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and an initiating into the Church, though as a different Church; ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Subjects, and Church Members, upon different grounds, and to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ends, as before, and in a far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner; one to be done in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Houſe, and by a private Hand,

               <p>But now becauſe there is ſome Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy in ſome things, is there therefore ground to conclude, it cometh into the room, ſtead, and uſe thereof? by no means; for by the ſame Argument we may as well conclude, that it cometh in the room and ſtead of the <hi>Ark, Manna, Rock,</hi> &amp;c.

Who ſaith, <hi>That the Argument from Circumciſion is invalid upon infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite conſiderations: Figures and Types prove nothing, unleſs a Commandment go along with them, or ſome expreſs to ſignifie ſuch to be their purpoſe: For the Deluge of Waters, and the Ark of</hi> Noah, <hi>were a Figure of Baptiſme ſaid</hi> Peter; <hi>and if therefore the Circumſtances of one ſhould be drawn to the other, we ſhould make Baptiſme a Prodigy, rather than a Rite; the Paſchal Lamb was a Type
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:103577:126"/> of the Euchariſt, which ſucceeds the other, as Baptiſme doth to Circumciſion; but becauſe there was in the manducation of the Paſchal Lamb no preſcription of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental drink, ſhall we thence conclude that the Euchariſt is to be adminiſtred but in one kind? And even in the very Inſtance of this Argument, ſuppoſing a Correſpondency of Analogy between Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and Baptiſme, yet there is no Correſpondence of Identity; for although it were granted, that both of them did conſign the Covenant of faith, yet there is nothing in the Circumſtance of Childrens being Circumciſed that ſo concerns that Myſtery, but that it might very well be given to Children, and yet Baptiſme on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to men of Reaſon; becauſe Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on left a Character in the fleſh, which being imprinted upon Infants, did its work to them when they came to age, and ſuch a Character was neceſſary, becauſe there was no word added to the Sign; but Baptiſme imprints nothing that remains on the Body, and if it leaves a Character at all, it is upon the Soul, to which alſo the word is added, which is as much a part of the Sacrament, as the Sign it ſelf: for both which Reaſons it is requiſite, that the Parties Baptized ſhould be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:103577:126"/> of Reaſon, that they may be capable both of the word of the Sacrament, and the impreſs made upon the Spirit; ſince therefore the Reaſon of this Parity does wholly fail, there is nothing left to infer a neceſſity of complying in this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Wherein the nullity and utter inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy of Infants Baptiſme is made appear.</head>
               <p>THat it is no way ſafe for any to reſt contented with that Baptiſme which they received in their Infancy, may appear, becauſe ſuch their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is a meer nullity, an inſignificant nothing, in reſpect to the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Ordinance of Baptiſme; and the reaſon is plain, becauſe there is that wanting in it which is ſo eſſential to true Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>For firſt,<note place="margin">Neither right matter nor form.</note> there is as the right <hi>Subject</hi> of Baptiſme wanting, ſo the true Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal form is wanting alſo, as practiſed with us: For the <hi>External form</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed is not ſprinkling, or pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little Water upon the Head or Face, but a dipping the whole perſon under <hi>Water,</hi> and raiſing him up again, to figure out death, burial and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as before.</p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:103577:144"/>
               <p>If then <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>form</hi> be wanting; which is <hi>Eſſential</hi> to its <hi>being,</hi> it muſt needs be a nullity, for what is more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the being of a thing then mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and form, and how is it poſſible to define Baptiſme, or any thing elſe, where they are wanting; and which is ſuch a difficiency in that or any thing elſe that makes it a non-entity, or a meer nullity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But 'tis ſaid there was the right words of Baptiſme, it was done in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So there was alſo in bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of <hi>Bells</hi> and <hi>Churches,</hi> which in your judgment is ſo far from making it a right <hi>Ordinance,</hi> the true Subject being wanting, that it is no leſs then a prophanation thereof, and a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble taking of the name of God in <hi>vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And farther to demonſtrate and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate this point, you know it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally owned, that Baptiſme is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then our myſtical <hi>Marriage,</hi> as being the <hi>ſolemnization</hi> of a <hi>mutual</hi> conſent and <hi>ſtriking</hi> of a Covenant (the

               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>mutual conſent</hi> in Marriage is ſo eſſential an <hi>Ingredient,</hi> that without it there is no Marriage, being as <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith, <hi>the formal cauſe thereof,</hi> becauſe only <hi>Conſent makes the Marriage,</hi> as ſaith the Lawyers; ſo that if there ſhould be only the conſent of one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is but like a bargain wherein on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one ſide is agreed; for as well known there is <hi>no Covenant,</hi> where no <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi>

            <p>So Acts 22.16. Ananias <hi>exhorts</hi> Paul, <hi>after his Confeſſion, to ariſe and be baptiſed,</hi> with a <hi>Why tarrieſt thou?

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103577:201"/> 
               <hi>Church,</hi> but, Ariſe and be <hi>Baptiſed</hi> in the <hi>firſt</hi> place.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Jailor, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.33. muſt after his converſion, <hi>ſtraitway,</hi> yea, <hi>in that ſame hour of the night, without further delay, be baptiſed,</hi> as a thing not to be neglected for a moment.</p>
            <p>And ſo alſo <hi>Cornelius</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. though he was Baptized ſo eminently with the Spirit, yet muſt forthwith <hi>be commanded to be baptized with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> a thing by no means to be deſerred, as <hi>Peters</hi> words imply, who upon his ſeeing him ſo filled with the Spirit, ſaith, <hi>Can any man forbid Water that theſe ſhould not be Baptiſed,</hi> &amp;c. No ſure, no man of Knowledg or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, can do it, or will admit of delayes therein.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon hereof is plain, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was the <hi>Liſting, Espouſing, Covenanting, Ingrafting, Implanting</hi> Ordinance; Believers being expreſly ſaid hereby to be <hi>planted into</hi> Chriſt, Gal. 3.27. and <hi>Baptiſed into Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 6.3. And which Baptizing and Planting into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is no other but an <hi>Orderly</hi> entring <hi>into the Viſible</hi> Church, or Body of Chriſt, as ſo fully expreſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. An <hi>Order</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:103577:201"/> faithfully to be obſerved as a <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Practice,</hi> Heb. 6.2. &amp; which muſt be kept, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.21. and duly regarded, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1, 2. upon the ſevere penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties threatned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.19. 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22, 23.</p>
            <p>And which lies ſo full and clear in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that it hath obtained an <hi>univerſal Conſent</hi> by moſt that have owned the Chriſtian Religion, and in any Form profeſſed the ſame, whether <hi>Papiſts, Proteſtants, Independants, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſts.</hi> In ſo much that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf in his plain <hi>Scripture</hi> proof, <hi>p.</hi> 126. ſaith, <hi>That if any ſhall be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent as to ſay, it is not the meaning of Chriſt, that</hi> Baptizing <hi>ſhould immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly follow</hi> Diſcipling, <hi>they are confuted by the conſtant Example of</hi> Scripture. <hi>So that,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I dare ſay, this will be out of doubt with all rational, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, impartial Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that Mr. <hi>Bunian,</hi> in his oppoſing this Principle, may well be ſaid, Not only <hi>not to pleaſe God,</hi> but to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all men.</hi> And whoſe return to Mr. <hi>Paul</hi> hereupon is ſo ridiculous, that it may not be unworthy your knowledg, as witneſſing either his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregious Ignorance, or Self-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

You will not find them eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to conclude with you againſt me, they are agaiſt your manner of Dipping, as well as Subject of Water-Baptiſm; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do you, for all you flatter them, agree together in all but the Subject; Do you allow their</hi> Sprinkling? <hi>Do you allow their Signing with the</hi> Croſs? <hi>Why then have you ſo ſtoutly an</hi> hundred <hi>times over condemned theſe things as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian? I am not againſt every man, though by your abuſive Language you would ſet every one againſt me; but am for Union, Concord and Communion with
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103577:202"/> Saints as Saints, and for that cauſe I wrote my Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is that he calls his <hi>Anſwer;</hi> but let all the world judg, whether he hath ſo much as once taken the leaſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Paul</hi> tells him, his Principle and Practice oppoſes all thoſe named as us, <hi>viz.</hi> Who do <hi>own</hi> with us as a <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> ſhould <hi>precede</hi> Church-Fellowſhip; and therefore in their ſence of Baptiſm (which is not in the Queſtion, either as to Subject or Circumſtance) do practiſe it according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not admitting any <hi>Unbaptiſed</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into their Fellowſhip. And the truth whereof, if Mr. <hi>Bunian</hi> doubt, beſides their Writings, I could give him ſome late inſtances of grown <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> not <hi>Sprinkled in Infancy,</hi> that muſt not be admitted upon account of their <hi>Saintſhip</hi> into <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> till they had Water ſprinkled, or <hi>poured</hi> upon their <hi>faces,</hi> and that by ſome that he hath leaned upon as Patrons.</p>
            <p>But what doth he reply to this, how doth he acquit himſelf from this Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, ſo differing in Principle and Practice from all? They differ from you in the manner, as well as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103577:203"/> I am not againſt every man — but am for Union, Concord and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Saints.

               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> By his declaring ſo often,<note place="margin">6. That Baptiſm is no Church-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> and ſo poſitively, That <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is not a <hi>Church-Ordinance,</hi> whereby he bears up himſelf exceedingly in his <hi>Notion:</hi> To which I would ſay, It muſt either be an <hi>Ordinance</hi> leſt by Chriſt for the <hi>Church to manage</hi> and order, or to the <hi>World,</hi> for I know no <hi>medium:</hi> But that he left no ſuch holy Appointment to be managed by the <hi>ignorant prophane</hi> World, but to the Church only, I thus prove. 1. Becauſe he hath committed the <hi>Ministry</hi> to <hi>them</hi> to Teach and <hi>Convert,</hi> which muſt precede <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and qualifie for it. 2. That to the Church belongs <hi>ordinarily</hi> to receive the account of ſuch <hi>Converſion,</hi> that it may be better underſtood, whether the Party deſiring Baptiſme, doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with all the heart; and that he hath brought forth <hi>fruits</hi> meet for <hi>Repentance,</hi> before he be baptiſed with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103577:205"/> the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> of it. 3. That to them belongs the <hi>appointing</hi> of the <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strators</hi> and faithful Witneſſes to ſee it orderly <hi>performed;</hi> otherwiſe Women, Apoſtates, or any, as ſome hold, may do it: <hi>God is a God of Order, and not of Confuſion.</hi> And <hi>all things are to be done to Edification.</hi> 4. Becauſe it is an <hi>entrance</hi> and <hi>door</hi> into the Viſible Church, as hath been amply in the foregoing Treatiſe proved, and the foregoing <hi>Scriptures</hi> evidence, and which is ſo clear, ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that they muſt deny <hi>Scripture</hi> that deny it. It is true (as Mr. <hi>Paul</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms) that Perſons entered into the Viſible Church hereby, are by conſent <hi>admitted</hi> into particular <hi>Congregations,</hi> where they may claim their <hi>Priviledges</hi> due to Baptized Believers, being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly <hi>put into the Body,</hi> and put on Chriſt by their Baptiſmal <hi>Vow</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> for by that publick <hi>Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of conſent is the <hi>Marriage</hi> and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn <hi>Contract</hi> made betwixt Chriſt and the Believer in Baptiſme, as before at large. And if it be <hi>propostrous</hi> and <hi>wicked</hi> for a Man and Woman to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite together, and to enjoy the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103577:205"/> of a <hi>Marriage-ſtate,</hi> without the paſſing of that publick <hi>Solemnity;</hi> So it is no leſs <hi>diſorderly</hi> upon a <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> account, for any to claim the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of a Church, or be admitted to the ſame till the paſſing of this <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity</hi> by them.</p>
            <p>But 'tis not done in the Church? No more is Viſiting the Sick, or anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with Oyl, are they not therefore Church-Ordinances?</p>
            <p>If any deſire further <hi>Satisfaction</hi> upon this <hi>Argument,</hi> they may peruſe two <hi>Treatiſes,</hi> one written by Mr. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> called, <hi>Baptiſmal Abuſes diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Diſproving the Lawfulneſs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and verity of Believers Baptiſm, with the irregularity of mixt Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Baptiſed and Unbaptiſed,</hi> written 1653.
